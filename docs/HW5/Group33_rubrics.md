|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|doc page entries|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|
|Use of version control tools|
|Use of style checkers |config files in GH showing your config|
|Use of code formatters. |config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config|
|Use of syntax checkers. |config files iin  GH showing this checker's config  |
|Use of code coverage |config files in GH|
|Other automated analysis tools|config files in GH|
|Test cases exist|dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base|
|Test cases are routinely executed|E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|
|Chat channel: exists|Link or screenshots|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|
|Short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|
