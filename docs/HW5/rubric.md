|Notes|Score|Evidence|
|-----|---------|---------|
|Video1|NA||
|Video2|NA|| 
|Workload is spread over the whole team|3|Github|
|Number of commits|3|Github|
|Number of commits: by different people|3||Github|
|Issues reports: there are **many**|0|Github|
|Issues are being closed|0|Github|
|DOI badge: exists|3|Github|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |0|Github|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |0|Github
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|doc page entries|0|Github|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|0|Github
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|0|Github
|Use of version control tools|3|Github|
|Use of style checkers |config files in GH showing your config|3|Github|
|Use of code formatters. |0|||
|Use of syntax checkers. |config files iin  GH showing this checker's config |0|||
|Use of code coverage |config files in GH|3|Github|
|Other automated analysis tools|3|Github|
|Test cases exist|dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base|3|Github|
|Test cases are routinely executed|3|Github|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|2|Github|
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|0|||
|Chat channel: exists|1|No way of knowing|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|0|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|3||
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|3||
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|3||
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|0|No way of knowing|
|Short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|1|Github|
