|Workload is spread over the whole team|3|Github, Insights, Contributors, commit numbers between 6 to 34|
|Number of commits|3|Github|
|Number of commits: by different people|3|Github, Total 106|
|Issues reports: there are **many**|3|Github, 2 closed|
|Issues are being closed|2|Github, 2 closed|

|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |0|Github|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |1|Only explained in main readme|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|0|Github|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|3|Readme file|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|0|Non existent|
