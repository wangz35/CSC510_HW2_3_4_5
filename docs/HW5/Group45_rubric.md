|Notes|Score|Evidence|
|-----|---------|---------|
|Video1|NA||
|Video2|NA||
|Workload is spread over the whole team|2|Github insigths, not well distributed enough|
|Number of commits|3|Github 136 commits|
|Number of commits: by different people|2|Github, everyone committed not distributed enough|
|Issues reports: there are **many**|0|Github, none|
|Issues are being closed|0|Github, none|
|DOI badge: exists|3|Github, readme|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |2|Github|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |2|Github|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|1|Github|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|0|Github|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|0|Github, none existent|

|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|3|Github|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|3|Github, people are well distributed among files|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|3|Github|
